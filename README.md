# ShopScene
Attention: [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/)  is needed to clone the project, as the 
burst package contains files with a size of more than 100 MB, which cant be pushed without lfs. 
As burst was listed by the URP as a direct dependency (in Packages/packages-lock.json), 
I thought it was better not to remove it.
