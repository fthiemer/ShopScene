# ShopScene
Build for the application at PsyCurio by Frederick Thiemer.

# Documentation
The GameObjects in the ShopScene holding important functionality are marked with tags used for setup and testing.
The tags are stored in a static class in Assets/Scripts/Tags.cs.


# Known Bugs
In the Editor after testing, most likely due to a problem with the Input System, all devices are removed and the 
following error pops up: "A Native Collection has not been disposed, resulting in a memory leak. Allocated from:...".
